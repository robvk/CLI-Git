# Homework CLI-GIT Week 1

## Todo list

### **1. Practice the concepts**

Just reading articles and watching videos will not be enough to fully understand the concepts that are covered every week. It is important to start doing things yourself and struggle a little doing so ;).

Let's start with some CLI practice:

1. [bashcrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl#try-it-online-with-mybinder) - a game to learn the command line! Follow the instructions to create a `binder` and click on Terminal once in the `binder`. Play around and read the scrolls as they will explain things to you.

Then once you are more comfortable with using the CLI, have a go at the following practical exercises:

1. [Learn Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - This is an interactive webpage that will guide you into the most common git workflows. If you get really stuck then this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG0ke9vILQM) goes through it, but only use this in emergencies.
2. [Learn Git Version Control (Scenario 1 - 4)](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)
3. [How to Use GIT and GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

### **2. Prep exercise**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `GIT-CLI` fork, go to the folder `week1`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercise1`. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

### **3. Setting up SSH**

> NOTE: If you are in an AZC and using their internet then the SSH port will be blocked which means it will not work. You will have to skip this part for now and always use the https way of working.

When working with GitHub we want to ensure the same level of security. Thus, we will have to make an SSH key and link it to GitHub as described in the reading materials. Go through the following:

- [How to generate an SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [Adding SSH Key to GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw)

## SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!

There is no homework this week, spend your time working on the parts you found difficult!
